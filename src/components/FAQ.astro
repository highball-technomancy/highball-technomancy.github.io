              We believe in transparency and community-driven development. Some of our projects are fully open-source, while others (like Permafrost during early development) are private with invitation-only access. Check our GitHub organization for available open-source projects, but pardon our dust. We're still growing, afterall.

              Permafrost uses Claude AI to analyze market conditions and provide trading recommendations. The AI acts as a supervisory manager, reviewing strategies and suggesting adjustments. You maintain full control—the AI suggests, you decide.

              Absolutely! Permafrost includes a comprehensive sandbox mode that simulates real market conditions. Test your strategies, refine your grids, and build confidence before going live. Sandbox mode behaves identically to live trading—just without the financial risk.

              Basic knowledge of Docker and command-line interfaces is recommended. If you can run Docker containers and follow setup instructions, you can run Permafrost. We provide detailed documentation and are building a more user-friendly installation process.

              Trading, whether manual or automated, always carries risk. Permafrost provides tools to help you execute strategies systematically, but it cannot eliminate market risk. Always start with small amounts, use sandbox mode extensively, and never invest more than you can afford to lose. We are not financial advisors.

              Our commitment to transparency extends to all our products. We aim to make our tools open-source whenever possible, allowing the community to audit, contribute, and benefit from our work. Some products may start private during early development but will eventually become publicly available. Some of our more ambitious products, however...well....we will just release those to the wild.
